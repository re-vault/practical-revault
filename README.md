# Practical revault

A protocol sketch for communication between the different entities in the [Revault
architecture](revault.pdf).


This repo is for us to bikeshed on the actual and practical architecture before
moving forward with the implementation.  
Anyone is welcome for bikeshedding with us, to raise issues for either asking questions
about, or pointing out actual issues with the "protocol".


JSON is used to straightforwardly describe messages here but the actual encoding
isn't decided yet.
